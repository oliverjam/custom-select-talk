I rewatched Stranger Things recently, and there's a scene where the kids need to build a sensory-deprivation tank. They have to phone up their teacher on the weekend and plead with him to give them instructions. Imagine if he didn't pick up? It look me less than 5 seconds to search for and find detailed instructions on the web.

So we have this amazingly powerful tool for almost infinite knowledge. The problem is that not everybody can access it.


## Design for everyone

A good example from Government Digital Services (who build the gov.uk site): they built an accessible form for ordering a replacement passport, which they user-tested. When a deaf person tried to finish the form they got stuck on the phone number input, because there was no way to indicate that she couldn't answer the phone. Based on this feedback GDS added a checkbox allowing users to indicate their preference for text or phone communicationâ€”which also benefits people like me who hate phone calls.
